# StudentApp 
## Another boring CRUD full-stack application :-) 
## I'm at the beginning of learning React, and this is one of my first applications written using this library. First, I created a very simple application in Spring that allows basic operations on resources. Then I created a graphical interface for it using React.
### I used here basic Hooks (like useState, useEffect, useNavigate, useParams), Routing, Axios library and I also used Bootstrap.
